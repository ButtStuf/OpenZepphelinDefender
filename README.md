# Defender Autotask Examples

_This repository is still under construction_

This repository contains sample code snippets for [Defender Autotasks](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/autotasks). Each snippet is self-contained, and is set up so you can copy-paste it directly into your Autotask with minimal changes.

**Disclaimer**: The scripts in this repository have not been audited. Please file an issue if you stumble upon any mistake.

- The [`keep3rs`](keep3rs) folder contains autotasks for usage with the [Keep3r Network](https://keep3r.network/).
